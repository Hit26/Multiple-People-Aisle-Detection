This is our solution for the Tractor Supply’s “Life out Here” AI/ML Hackathon (Customer Interactions with Store Layout) (https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/tractor-supply-hackathon/).  This is a system that is able to track the amount of time a person spends in a particular section in CCTV footage. We build this using Deep SORT and YOLOv4.
